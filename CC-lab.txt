Exp-1
a)
1)create an ec2 with key pair of .ppk, copy ip of it
2) open putty, paste the ip
3)left side, connection->ssh->auth->credentials, browse the .ppk and click open 
4)if Linux login as:ec2-user, if Ubuntu login as:ubuntu,                  test: whoami(console)

b)convert .pem file to .ppk using puttyGen, save as private key file, follow same process

c)RDP
1) create ec-2 in security groups add rdp in the custom tcp, select os:windows
2) click on connect, using RDP client, click get password, upload the .pem file to decrypt 
3) click window symbol and search RDP, paste ip of the ec-2
4) login as Administrator, password: decrypted password
5)you can see the new system

Exp-2 
Volumes
a) create a ec2 select AZ 
create volume with same AZ size anything 
attach volume to running ec2 and device name /dev/sdf 
open ec2 console and just do lsblk 
b)
after attaching and connecting to ec2 
sudo su
lsblk -fs
fdisk /dev/nvme1n1    (m,n,p, , , , w)
lsblk
mkfs.xfs /dev/nvme1n1p1
mkdir /mnt/vish
mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/vish
df -h
blkid /dev/nvme1n1p1
(COPY UUID)
nano /etc/fstab
(inside that last line add)=UUID=<UUID-value>   /mnt/vish   xfs   defaults,nofail   0   0
mount -a
reboot and check for files 
c) create another ec-2 with same AZ, detach the volume from old ec2 and attach to new one
in ec2 terminal 
mkdir /mnt/vish 
mount /dev/nvme1n1p1 /mnt/vish
lsblk -fs

SnapShots
1) for a given volume you created click on actions->create snapshot
2) from snapshots section click on copy snapshot and select some region
3) switch to that region and create a volume for it from actions 
4) attach an ec2 in that region to the created volume with same AZ
(we can do lsblk if needed)

Exp-3
1) create 2 ec-2 with 2 diff availability zones and include nfs in the custom tcp
2) create an efs with only 2 availability zones 
3) now open consoles of both ec2
4) commands for both 
sudo su
mkdir efs
yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
(connect the efs with dns)efs->connect->dns->paste in console 
cd efs
in any 1 do nano h.txt and put text 
shows in other 

EXP-4
a) 
1) create s3 bucket, allow acls under ownership
2) block all public class uncheck that very imp 
3) versioning enable better coz others need 
4) after creation click on bucket->permissions->acl->public access->right side vala(tick)
5) upload any image and click on that->permissions->acl->public access->left and right vala tick
6) properties->copy link->incog

b)
1) enable versioning for this compulsory 
2) upload a text file and change that in local system and upload again 
3) buckets->objects->click show versions-> you can see
4) delete the latest version and old version still shows up 

c) Cross region replication 
1) create 1 more bucket in diff region with same process including having versions
2) go to first bucket-> management->replication rules
3) status=enable, source bucket= apply to all objects, destination bucket=select the created one, IAM-role=lab role, replicate existing objects->no(this comes after creating)
4) upload any file in bucket1, it will automatically show in 2nd bucket 

d) static website hosting 
1) upload a index, error.html into s3 with following the normal process of creation including setting of acl, allow static hosting and put index, error in fields
2) click on index.html->permissions -> everyone -> both tick , same with error.html also
3) bucket->properties->scroll(static website hosting)->copy url->check 


EXP-5
1) create a vpc, cidr:10.0.0.0/16
2) subnets public: AZ-east-1a, subnet cidr:10.0.1.0/24
	   private: AZ-east-1a, subnet cidr:10.0.2.0/24
3) Internet gateway, attach the vpc(shown after creation)
4) Create route table:
		public: create, actions->edit routes->add route->destination:0.0.0.0/0, internet gateway(put the custom made),   actions->edit subnet associations -> add the public subnet
		private: create, actions->edit subnet associations -> add the private subnet
5) public subnet->actions->edit subnet settings-> auto assign ip (tick)
6) create a security group, add the custom made vpc under the creation, inbound rules: ssh,http,https
7) create an ec-2 for public subnet, edit network->vpc(custom), subnet:public, select existing security group:custom made
8) do the same for ec-2 of private subnet
9) connect to both public subnet ec-2 will connect, other will not
